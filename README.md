- 👋 Hi, I’m @drewseph-grows (chef.rojo on IG)
- Consider this a guide for those starting from scratch, and a forum for those who wish to contribute. All I ask in advance is peace, respect and keep it community. 
- 🌱 We're automating home-grown cannabis using Arduino and some light robotics/software stuff to take all that time that could be spent watering, adjusting the many moving parts involved, and saving it for what matters: showing the plants some love and enjoying that sweet cheeba.
- 💞️ Let's collaborate on any and all ideas, fixes, revisions you may have... "Where we go one, we go all."
- 📫 For these purposes, let's do contact by email or IG exclusively. We'll expand the community to other platforms as it grows, and there'll be matching YouTube videos to what we do here in the coming months.
